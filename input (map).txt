Simple life quotes that are just one line are purposefully short.
They can help us focus on a single concept and really use it to manifest our own intentions and goals.
Plus, another great thing about these quotes is that they're easy to write in a journal, quick to jot down in a planner, or post on a bulletin board.
Wherever you need a boost of inspiration for your daily life, these inspirational quotes can have a positive impact on your day.
